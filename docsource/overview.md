## Overview

The Palo Alto Universal Orchestrator extension enables Keyfactor Command to manage cryptographic certificates on Palo Alto devices such as firewalls and Panorama management systems. Certificates in Palo Alto networks are used for various security features, such as secure communication and authentication between devices. By leveraging the orchestrator, administrators can automate the management of these certificates, ensuring they are up to date and properly distributed across the network.

Defined Certificate Stores for this orchestrator represent locations on Palo Alto devices where certificates are stored and managed. These stores can be at different levels, such as the firewall level, the Panorama level, or within specific Panorama templates. Each Certificate Store acts as a logical grouping of certificates, simplifying the process of inventorying, adding, and removing certificates on the target system.
